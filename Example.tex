\section{Introduction}
TeXShop is a free \LaTeX{} and \TeX{} editor/previewer for OS X. It can be downloaded from \url{http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/}. The default black and white colour scheme is quite bland and can be straining on the eyes, so I have created some custom themes. Currently there are $2$ themes available, which are based on popular themes available in text editors such as Atom and Sublime. They can be downloaded from GitHub (\url{https://github.com/monikajaskolka/TeXShop-Themes}).

The theme modifies the look of the following \LaTeX() elements:

\begin{enumerate}
		\item background colour
		\item text colour (e.g. such as \ldots)
		\item keyword colour 
		\item comment colour % (e.g. this comment)
		\item cursor colour 
		\item \{\} and \$ symbols {} $ $
		\item index terms (e.g. \index{Example})
		\item colour of \{\} and enclosed background when highlighted (cursor is near bracket)
\end{enumerate}
